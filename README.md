## üíª About the project

This Flask CRUD API provides basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a database. The API utilizes HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to perform these operations on a specified resource. The API accepts JSON payloads and responds with JSON data. The API is designed to be flexible and easily customizable to fit various use cases. To use the API, simply specify the resource and endpoint in the URL, and the appropriate HTTP method and payload in the request.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionalities

The project provides a generic Flask CRUD API that supports the following functionalities:

Create: Allows users to create new records in the database by sending a POST request with a JSON payload to the API endpoint.

Read: Allows users to retrieve records from the database by sending a GET request with an optional query string parameter to filter the results. If no filter is specified, all records are returned.

Update: Allows users to update existing records in the database by sending a PUT request with a JSON payload to the API endpoint, specifying the record to be updated.

Delete: Allows users to delete records from the database by sending a DELETE request to the API endpoint, specifying the record to be deleted.

The API supports JSON payloads for all requests and responds with JSON data for all requests. The API is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to specify the resource and endpoint in the URL, and the appropriate HTTP method and payload in the request. The API also includes error handling and validation to ensure that data is properly formatted and the correct HTTP status codes are returned.

## üöÄ How to run the project

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Copy and paste the following command into the terminal window:

   ```BASH SCRIPT
   echo "---> Setting up Pipenv"&& python -V && rm -fr ".venv" && python -m venv .venv && .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat && python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install pipenv install
   ```

   This command sets up a Python virtual environment using Pipenv, upgrades pip, and installs the required packages for the project.
4. This command activates the virtual environment and sets up the necessary environment variables.
of `.evn.exemple` for `.env`
5. Finally, run the following command to start the Flask app:

    ```BASH SCRIPT
   python -m api.app
   ```

   This command starts the Flask development server and makes the app available at the default URL `http://localhost:8080`.

That's it! Your airtech-os should now be up and running.

## üöÄ How to run project with Docker üê≥

1. Prerequisites:
Make sure you have installed Docker on your system and have a copy of the source code for the project where the container will be built.

2. Build the Docker image:
Use the command `docker build -t airtech-os`. to create a new Docker image using the provided Dockerfile. Make sure you are in the correct directory where the Dockerfile is present.

3. Run the Docker container:
Use the command `docker run --name AIRTECH-OS -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env airtech-os` to run the Docker container with the necessary settings. This command will start the container using the airtech-os image, set the .env file's environment variables, and map the host's port 8080 to the container's port 8080.

4. Verify running Docker container:
After running the container, verify that the application or service inside the container is working correctly. You can access the application through the browser using the address **<http://localhost:8080>** or check the output of the container logs with the AIRTECH-OS docker logs command.

5. Finishing the execution of the Docker container:
To end the running container, run the `docker stop AIRTECH-OS` command to stop the running container. If you want to completely delete the container, run the docker rm AIRTECH-OS command.
